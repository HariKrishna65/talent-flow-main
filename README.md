# TalentFlow

TalentFlow is a modern, feature-rich hiring management platform designed to streamline the recruitment process for HR teams and offer a seamless application experience to candidates. Built with **React**, **Vite**, **Dexie (IndexedDB for local storage)**, and a modern component/UI toolkit powered by **Tailwind CSS** & **Radix UI**.

- **Assessment Management:** Build, assign, and edit job assessments (multi-section, multiple question types).
- **Application Flow:** Candidates can apply to jobs and attempt dedicated assessments.

## Usage & Roles

- **HR Users:** Can manage jobs/candidates, create & modify assessments, track applicant progress, and move candidates through the pipeline.
- **Candidates:** Can browse/apply to jobs, attempt assigned assessments, and review their progress.
- **Login:** Simple in-browser (no backend auth). Select HR or Candidate on the home page.

---

## Key Functionality Overview

- **Jobs (`/jobs`):** All job opportunities. HR can add, update, archive, and reorder jobs. Candidates can browse and show interest.
- **Candidates (`/candidates`):** Pipeline of applicants. Filter/search, view detailed profiles, view application timelines, and manage notes.
- **Kanban Board (`/candidates/kanban`):** Visual pipeline for moving candidates between recruiting stages.
- **Assessments (`/assessments`):** HR can create and assign assessments per job, customize sections/questions. Candidates can access and attempt assessments.
- **Persistence:** All changes are stored in your browser (IndexedDB); the "mock API" makes the app feel like a real backend exists.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- **UI Components:** Check `src/components/ui/` for all generic reusable UI.
- **Auth & Routing:** See `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` and `src/App.jsx` for user flows and role protection.
- **Data/Backend Simulation:** All requests are mocked via `msw` (handled in-browser, see `src/lib/mock-api.js`).
