TALENT-FLOW

Overview
- Talent-Flow is a React + Vite single-page application for managing jobs, candidates, and job assessments.
- It includes HR tools to create and manage assessments and a candidate flow to attempt and submit assessments.

Tech Stack
- React 18, Vite 5 (JavaScript)
- React Router v6
- Dexie (IndexedDB) for local persistence
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) to simulate a backend (API under `/api`)
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI) + Tailwind CSS
- TanStack Query (light usage)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)

Install
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

Run the app (development)
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts Vite and shows a local URL (typically http://localhost:5173). Open it in your browser.

Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # serve the production build locally
```

Available Scripts
- npm run dev: Start the Vite dev server
- npm run build: Build production assets
- npm run build:dev: Development-mode build
- npm run preview: Preview the build locally
- npm run lint: Run ESLint

Project Structure (key paths)
- src/
  - main.jsx: App bootstrap, starts MSW and seeds IndexedDB
  - App.jsx: Routes and providers (Auth, Query, Tooltip, Toasters)
  - contexts/AuthContext.jsx: Simple client auth with roles (`hr` or `candidate`)
  - lib/db.js: Dexie database (jobs, candidates, timelines, assessments, responses)
  - lib/mock-api.js: MSW handlers that simulate `/api/*` endpoints backed by Dexie
  - lib/seed-data.js: Seeds jobs, candidates, and assessments on first run
  - components/ui/*: UI primitives
  - components/AssessmentPreview.jsx: Live preview of assessment questions
  - pages/
    - Index.jsx: Landing/login
    - Jobs.jsx, JobDetails.jsx: Job listings and details
    - Candidates.jsx, CandidatesKanban.jsx, CandidateProfile.jsx: HR candidate tools
    - Assessments.jsx, CreateAssignment.jsx, AssessmentBuilder.jsx, AttemptAssessment.jsx

Architecture
- SPA-only frontend. No real server is required for development.
- Data access flows through MSW handlers in `src/lib/mock-api.js`, which persist to IndexedDB via Dexie in `src/lib/db.js`.
- Authentication is client-only using `localStorage` via `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`. Roles: `hr` and `candidate`.
- Routing is defined in `src/App.jsx` with `ProtectedRoute` guarding role-based access.
- Initial data is generated by `src/lib/seed-data.js` and invoked from `src/main.jsx` during app startup.

Routing (high level)
- /: Index (login/select role)
- /jobs, /jobs/:jobId
- /candidates, /candidates/kanban, /candidates/:id (HR only)
- /assessments
- /assessments/create (HR)
- /assessments/:jobId/builder (HR)
- /assessments/:jobId/attempt (Candidate)

Assessments: How it works
Data Model (simplified) – see `src/lib/db.js`
- Assessment: { id, jobId, sections: Section[], createdAt }
- Section: { id, title, questions: Question[] }
- Question: { id, type, text, required?, options?, minValue?, maxValue?, maxLength? }
- AssessmentResponse: { id, assessmentId, candidateId, answers, submittedAt }

HR Flow
1) Navigate to Assessments → Create New Assignment (`/assessments/create`).
2) Select a Job. The form generates job-related starter questions (you can edit/add/remove).
3) Save the assessment (stored in IndexedDB via Dexie).
4) Optionally refine using the Builder (`/assessments/:jobId/builder`).

Candidate Flow
1) Navigate to Assessments as a candidate.
2) Click “Attempt Assessment” on a job that has an assessment.
3) Complete sections/questions at `/assessments/:jobId/attempt` with validation.
4) Submit to save an `AssessmentResponse` in IndexedDB.

Styling & UI
- Tailwind CSS configured in `tailwind.config.js`.
- Components under `src/components/ui` are shadcn/ui-based primitives.

Extending or Integrating a Backend
- Replace MSW/Dexie calls with real API requests. Keep data shapes consistent or update types/usage accordingly.
- Suggested approach: create an API client layer, swap MSW handlers for live endpoints, and migrate persistence out of IndexedDB.

Known Issues & Limitations
- Demo-only auth: Client-side `localStorage` auth meant for demos; not secure for production.
- MSW simulated failures: `simulateNetwork()` introduces latency and random errors (e.g., ~5% network error). Job reorder endpoint can randomly fail (~10%) to emulate transient issues.
- IndexedDB persistence: Seeded data persists between reloads; clear browser storage to reset.
- TypeScript vs JavaScript: The codebase currently uses `.jsx`/`.js` runtime files, though TypeScript tooling is present in devDependencies.
- File uploads: If surfaced in the UI, uploads are placeholders with no real storage.
- Performance: Initial seeding creates ~1000 candidates; first load may take slightly longer.

Technical Decisions
- MSW + Dexie for a realistic local-first demo without requiring a backend.
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind for rapid, consistent UI development on top of Radix primitives.
- Role-based routing via a simple `ProtectedRoute` and context-driven auth state.
- TanStack Query is included for cache/fetch ergonomics but used lightly; most calls are straightforward.
- Deterministic string IDs in seeders to keep data stable and predictable across sessions (until storage is cleared).

Troubleshooting
- Blank Page or Module Errors:
  - Ensure Node >= 18 and dependencies installed successfully (`npm install`).
  - Delete `node_modules` and lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and reinstall.
  - Clear browser cache and IndexedDB for the site if data/state seems stuck.
- Port Already in Use:
  - Use: `npm run dev -- --port=5174`
- Type Errors in Editor:
  - TypeScript types are included in devDependencies; editors may show hints even though runtime code is JS.

Notes
- This project uses only client-side data storage (IndexedDB) during development. Submissions are not sent to a server.
